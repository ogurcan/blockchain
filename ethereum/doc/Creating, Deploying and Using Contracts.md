# Creating, Deploying and Using Contracts

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure that the Solidity compiler is installed as described [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Contract-Tutorial#install-solc-on-ubuntu).

This example is based on [Setting Up a Local Private Test Network](./Setting%20Up%20a%20Local%20Private%20Test%20Network%20with%20One%20Node.md) example.

It is prepared by using the geth version `1.5.7-stable` which is using Go version `go1.7.4` and tested on `macOS Sierra` and `Ubuntu 14.04.5`.
