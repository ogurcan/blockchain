# Simple Trader Contract

> This example is a continuation of the [Receiving Ethers Using a Contract](./Receiving Ethers Using a Contract.md) example.


## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure that the [Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html) compiler is installed as described [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Contract-Tutorial#install-solc-on-ubuntu). To verify if Solidy is installed correctly, go to the geth console and type the `eth.getCompilers()` command. 

``` js
> eth.getCompilers()
["Solidity"]
> 
```

This example is prepared by using the geth version `1.5.9-stable` which is using Go version `go1.7.3` and tested on `Ubuntu 14.04.5`.

## Introduction

In this example, we will develop a simple trading contract to how to define and use structures, arrays and functions in more detail.


You can only directly call the functions that do not modify the state of the contract, i.e. `constant functions`. Functions modifying the state of a contract (i.e. `non-constant function`) can only be called via transactions.
