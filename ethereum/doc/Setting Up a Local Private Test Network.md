# Setting Up a Local Private Test Network with One Node

## Introduction

The things that are required to specify in a private chain are:

* Custom Genesis File
* Custom Data Directory
* Custom NetworkID 

We also need to create a directory for the test network. 

    $ mkdir local_private_network

Then enter to this directory. 

    $ cd local_private_network
